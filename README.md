### Postcode
[Postcode data set](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons-postcode-directory-february-2022/about) - from geoportal.statistics.gov.uk website.
The full data set was too big to fit under the 25MB limit for file uploads on Github, so I manually deleted all the columns I knew I did not need (bad form, I know). The edited data set was then saved as a .csv file and can now be found in the main branch or can click [here](https://github.com/sofiariccomagno/msc_miniproject/blob/215951f2f9be116fc6dddaa1e3b77f2a114942ee/ONSPD_FEB_2022_UK.csv).
